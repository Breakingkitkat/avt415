	<h1>Project 1: Check Point 1</h1>
<h2>The Language of Sims</h2>
<content>Anyone who's played The Sims has likely experienced Simlish - the made-up iconic Sim language that, although nonsensical at its core, is still able to get multiple points and emotions across to the player. Simlish was created by The Sims creator Will Wright, who is believed to have explored different languages when creating Simlish. Wright ultimately decided he wanted a language that could be understood globally but also left a lot to the player's imagination, allowing for more creative and individualistic experiences.</content>
<h2>The Story of Vietnamese Pho</h2>
<content>The history of pho begins at the end of the 19th century, at the peak of French colonialism. French demand led to a greater availability of beef in Vietnam. This in turn produced a surplus of beef bones, which were used by Chinese and Vietnamese vendors to deepen and perfect the flavour of the broth.</content>
<h2>Son Doong Cave</h2>
<content>Son Doong is considered to be the largest cave in the world, based on volume and also the biggest cave in Vietnam, found by Ho Khanh â€“ a Phong Nha jungle man in 1990. In 2009, Hang Son Doong was officially surveyed and measured by the The British -Vietnam Cave Expedition Team led by Howard Limbert. The Expedition team then announced it as the world's largest natural cave with a volume of 38.5 million m3. The measurements were then accepted by a number of world's senior karst geologists including Dr. Tony Waltham. This team along with National Geographic magazine had announced Son Doong Cave as the largest natural limestone cave on the planet in the same year. In 2013, the Guinness World Records Organisation recorded it as the world's largest natural cave.</content>
